# Arcade game school assignment

since this was the first project I ever worked on and did it all by my self don`t expect amazing things. Although this might have been the case I am still very proud of what I managed to make with the no experience that i had.        

one of the things that I did not expect to get working was a wall that reveald itself when enterd. This is something that Iam very proud because it the first time i did anything like that.
